# Meddit

Meddit is a Reddit clone that I want to create for me and my friends


# Technologies

I use React in the front-end and Flask in the Backend and in the deployment I'm going to use Postgresql

# Requirements
Flask
flask-sqalchemy
flask-jwt-extended
flask-uploads

React
React-Router

#How to start

You should start the react app with npm start and then start the python Backend by running it (you can run it in any way)


#Have Fun!
